- My name is Matej Horvath and I am a 24 year old. Currently I am employed in The Shrimp
restaurant by Nyhavn as a waiter and bartender. I just graduated from ZIBAT school in
Roskilde getting a Bachelor’s of International Marketing and Sales Marketing degree.
During my first semester of studies of Commerce Management (AP) in Naestved I became a
mentor for the first year students, organizing team building activities, providing them with
basic knowledge of the Danish Education system and lifestyle, as well as helping with any
questions they might have.

Later during my studies I traveled to Florida for a seven month internship at Walt Disney
World, which allowed me to network with leaders and build transferable skills such as
problem solving, teamwork, and guest service on a daily basis. During this internship I
completed a Corporate Communication course focusing on Public Relations and how big
companies convey messages to the public and between departments. I was then asked to
work at the Figment: A Journey into the Imagination attraction where I introduced the show
five times a day. Due to the show consisting of one hundred people at a time, I was able to
develop exceptional public speaking skills.

Once I returned from Florida I started my Bachelor studies at ZIBAT Roskilde where I have
developed broader knowledge of marketing and sales. I applied for Erasmus program in
Malaysia (Summer 2020) which was unfortunately canceled four days before my departure
because of COVID-19.

In Fall of 2020 I interned for a Globalhagen hostel in Copenhagen in the Marketing and
Digital Communication department. During this internship I created Facebook campaigns
and ads. I started a project of email newsletters and gave suggestions of improvement on
the website.

Most recently I have finished an internship in Tivoli’s Sales department which taught me a lot
about how larger companies in Denmark operate as well as broadening my knowledge about
office administration, communication with coworkers to the best of my abilities MICE industry
as well as leisure tourism.

Being a waiter has made me aware of people's emotions and made it easy for me to read
people and communicate with them with ease and make connections with them. It has also
increased my punctuality and time management skills greatly as working in a fine dining
restaurant it is important to pay attention to all these aspects. Thanks to this presentation in
front of new people and large groups of people is easy for me, and I am able to take
command and guide people when needed.

Also being a gamer and passionate about video games made me extremely interested in
technical aspects of building my own computer and understanding all the technicalities
around it.
